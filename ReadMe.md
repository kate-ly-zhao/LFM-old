# Pre-processing for 3D Localization using Light-Field Microscopy data

This software is to perform some calibration and pre-processing operations on the light field microscopy (LFM) data, including:

- Detect the rotation angle of a raw LFM image.
- Detect lenslet pitch.
- Crop a region of interest (ROI) from each LFM frame.
- Detect the centers of the microlens array using an out-of-focus LFM image, instead of a white image.
- Extract micro-images to construct 4D LFM data.
- Convert 4D LFM data to multi-view / sub-aperture images.
- Perform matrix factorization to separate the foreground and background.
- Convert the foreground to a clean LF image.

Original data is from: 
[path]/Chronos_Test/chronos_190301/MLA_1x1_f_2-8_50ms_490nm_1
Now the data is copied to:
[path]/LFMdata/LFimg.tif

Usage:
----------------------------

Run 'main_LFM_preprocess.py' to explore each calibration and pre-processing operation.

If you want to use your own images, please put them in folder "LFMdata", update the 'WhiteImg.tif' with an appropriate out-of-focus light-field image, and update the data path and some parameters accordingly in the code file.
